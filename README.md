hello world project
Hi, I'm Kris.
I have some ideas that I think will be pretty great. So, in order for YOU to see these great ideas, I am learning all I can! 
I've always liked computers, so I figure it's about time I learn coding. I have a few favorite colors (since this is supposed to be an About Me thing) they are: Black, blue, red, purple, and neon green. In that order. 
Happy Coding! :)
